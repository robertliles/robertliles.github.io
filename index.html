    <h2>Bob Liles</h2>
    <p>
        I'm a software engineer and writer based in New York City. Most recently I worked at MongoDB for ten years building the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-database" target="_blank">MongoDB Atlas</a> data platform from the ground up.

        My writing includes fiction, art criticism, technical writing, and translation.
